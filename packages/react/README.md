# ILO Design System - React Package

## Status: Proof of Concept

This package provides the implementation of the Design System using [React](https://reactjs.org/). It also includes a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) project for documentation and development of React components.

This is just a POC, so the package doesn't expose components or include a build step. Only the Storybook project is implemented.

## Styling

Use the `styles` package to manage styling for React components
