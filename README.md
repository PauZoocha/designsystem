# ILO Design System

This monorepo contains packages comprising the Design System of the [International Labour Organization](https://www.ilo.org). Our goal is to make it easy for developers and designers to build accessible websites and web applications that implement the [ILO's brand identity](https://brand.ilo.org/hub/2).

The components in this Design System are completely customizable so that they can be easily integrated into other design systems or website themes.
