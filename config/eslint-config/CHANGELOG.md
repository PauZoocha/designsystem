# @ilo-org/eslint-config

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 977e15006: Fixes a bug where some distribution assets weren't getting included in Design System packages while a lot of non-essential development assets were. At the same time, this removes some `src` directories from the packages which some consumers might have been using.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- be8262383: Update eslint plugins

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 2f60e9d92: Make sure eslint treats broken prettier rules as errors

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 8e24e57fc: We've fixed broken exports from @ilo-org/react and ensured that types are exported properly as well. We've upgraded the @ilo-org/react Storybook project to version 7.0.0-beta. This has required us to decouple the installation and build scripts of the react and storybook projects. It's no longer possible to install dependencies and then build both storybook projects together. Instead, users should run `pnpm react:install` or `pnpm twig:install` before building the respective Storbyook project. This should be fixed when Wingsuit upgrades to Webpack5.
