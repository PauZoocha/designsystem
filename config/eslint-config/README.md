# @ilo/eslint-config

> ESLint configuration for ILO Design System. These docs are a WIP

## Getting started

To install `@ilo/eslint-config` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @ilo/eslint-config
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @ilo/eslint-config
```

## Usage

You can use `@ilo/eslint-config` in your project by extending it in your
`eslint` configuration. For example, if we had an `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@ilo/eslint-config"]
}
```
