Add a `gap` setting to the hero card that allows the developer to set an optional background color on the entire Hero,
which fills the "gap" between the bottom of the Hero Card and the bottom of the hero image when `align` is set to `bottom` or `baseline`. Options are `transparent`, `white`, `light` and `dark`.
